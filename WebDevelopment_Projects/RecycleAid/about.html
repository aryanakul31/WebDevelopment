		In RECYCLEAID we deal with the waste materials in various categories like electronics, food, medicine, paper, plastic and clothes.
		Here we are tied up with some companies who deal with these materials.
		The company just take away the waste material and reintroduce those materials to needy people.
		Or they can provide some help to the people who are suffering in the disaster place by giving them these materials.
		One more thing we also recycle the material in our own factory.
		We have one organisation linked with us, they do awareness campaign in some areasth about guiding them how they can reduce the waste material.
		Let us join our hands so that we can do the 3R-Reduce,Reuse and Recycle to our waste material.
