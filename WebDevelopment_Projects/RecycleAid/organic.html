	<p class="h2" align="center">Recycling Organic Waste</p>
	<center><img src="organic/o1.png" height="300" ></center>
	<p class="p2">
	Recycling of organic wastes such as crop residues, dung and urine from domesticated animals and wastage from slaughter house, human excreta and sewage, bio mass of weeds, organic wastes from fruit and vegetables production and household wastes, sugarcane trash, oilcakes, press mud and fly ash from thermal power plants. Material not suitable for direct application can better apply by composting and vermicompost.
<br><br>Two farming system have been proposed for ensuring sustainability. There are low input sustainable agriculture (LISA) and organic farming.
<p class="p">Low Input Sustainable Agriculture (LISA):</p>

<p class="p2">
In this system minimal use of external production inputs is made. The production costs are obviously lower. The over all risk of the farmer is considerably reduced.</p>
<center><img src="organic/o2.jpg" height="400" width="800"></center><br>
	<p class="p2">Four factors are most important for better growth of plant:<br>

1) Soil – 45% <br>
2) Organic matter – 5% <br>
3) Air – 25%<br>
4) Water = 25%<br>
	</p>
	<p class="p">Soil Classification on the Basis of Nutrient:</p>
	<p class="p2">Medium soil content- 1. Organic carbon = 0.41- 0.60.<br>
Available NPK kg/ ha- 1.N – 281 -420, 2. P – 14- 20, 3. K – 151- 200.<br><br>
	</p>
	<p class="p">Organic Farming and Waste Recycling:</p>
	<p class="p2">Organic farming is the backbone of sustainable agriculture. .Organic farming may result in compatable performance as conventional agriculture and crops growth with high organic manure application could tolerate the pest and disease attack better.<br>
	Organic recyclable waste include – crop residues, waste, farm industrial waste, multiple and sewage wastes. They are valuable sources of plant nutrient and humans in tropical and subtropical soils found in India, there is general deficiency of organic carbon and plant nutrients due to rapid loss of this component by bio- degradation. </p>
