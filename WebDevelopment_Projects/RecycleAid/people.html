There are some toxic (dangerous) chemicals in these products that don’t belong in the trash. It’s bad for our environment, plus it means throwing away valuable metals that can be recycled.</p></td>

The best thing to do is to give it to someone else who can keep using it (only if your parents say it’s ok.)  If you don’t find a family member or friend who wants it, you can often donate it to a charity in your community.</p></td>

			<p class="p1">Lawn And Garden</p><p class="p2">Use food scraps, yard trimmings, and other organic wastes to create a compost pile. Adding the compost you make to soil increases water retention, decreases erosion, and keeps organic materials out of landfills.<br> 
	Raise the cutting height of your lawnmower during hot summer months to keep grass roots shaded and cooler, reducing weed growth, browning, and the need for watering.<br>
	If you need large lawn and garden equipment such as tillers and chainsaws, you can reduce waste (and save money) by setting up a sharing program with your neighbors.<br>
	When you mow, “grasscycle” by leaving grass clippings on your lawn instead of bagging then. The clippings will return nutrients to the soil instead of taking up space in landfills.<br>
	Donate healthy plants that you want to replace to community gardens, parks and schools.<br>
	If you have a wood burning fireplace, save your ashes instead of throwing them away. Once cooled, wood ashes can be mixed into your compost heap and provide nutrients to your garden.</p><br>

Clean and properly store tools, toys and outdoor furniture to protect them from damage and keep them out of landfills.<br>
Turn off or unplug lights during the day. Doing so will save energy and help your lights last longer.<br>
Storms can cause power outages. Prevent waste by keeping rechargeable batteries for your flashlights. If you do use disposable batteries, reduce hazardous waste by buying ones with low mercury content.</p><br>

				<li class="p2">Pour the pulp into your bin or pan, then sink the mold into the water mixture. Pull the mold up, and pulp should cover the screen. At this point, you can add decorations. You can even add seeds to make plantable paper. Be sure to add a little more pulp to cover the decorations so they adhere to the paper.</li>
				<li class="p2">Use a cloth or sponge to press out excess water. Now you need to let the paper dry. You can let it dry on the screen, you can flip the mold over and let your paper dry on another surface, or you can press a cloth into the mold so the paper adheres to it and can dry on the cloth. Any of these options should work. Just be sure to let your paper dry for a day or so.</li>

			<p class="p2">Almost all medicines can be thrown into your household trash. These include prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs in pills, liquids, drops, patches, creams, and inhalers.<br>

Follow these steps:<br>

1. Remove the drugs from their original containers and mix them with something undesirable, such as used coffee grounds, dirt, or cat litter. This makes the medicine less appealing to children and pets and unrecognizable to someone who might intentionally go through the trash looking for drugs.<br>
2. Put the mixture in something you can close (a re-sealable zipper storage bag, empty can, or other container) to prevent the drug from leaking or spilling out.<br>
3. Throw the container in the garbage.<br>
4. Scratch out all your personal information on the empty medicine packaging to protect your identity and privacy. Throw the packaging away.<br>
5. If you have a question about your medicine, ask your health care provider or pharmacist.</p>
